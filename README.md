# Lineage for microG builds for the Xiaomi Mi 9T/Redmi K20 (davinci)

Official 17.1 builds are available. See https://download.lineage.microg.org/davinci/.

Under [Releases](https://github.com/krmax44/davinci-lineage-microg/releases), you can find unofficial LineageOS 18.1 builds that come with MicroG and F-Droid built-in. If you don't know what MicroG is, you probably want to use the default LineageOS builds.

## Installation

Once you unlocked the bootloader and installed the official [TWRP recovery](https://twrp.me/xiaomi/xiaomimi9t.html), you can boot to TWRP and flash the downloaded ZIP from the latest release.

OTA updates are available.

## Building yourself

See the [build script repo](https://github.com/krmax44/lineageos-microg-builder).
