# Lineage for microG builds for the Xiaomi Mi 9T/Redmi K20 (davinci)

Under [Releases](https://github.com/krmax44/davinci-lineage-microg/releases), you can find unofficial LineageOS builds that come with MicroG and F-Droid built-in. If you don't know what MicroG is, you probably want to use the default LineageOS builds.

Once `davinci` becomes an official LineageOS device, updates from me will stop and you can find official downloads at the [LineageOS for microG](https://lineage.microg.org/) site.

## Installation

Once you unlocked the bootloader and installed the official [TWRP recovery](https://twrp.me/xiaomi/xiaomimi9t.html), you can boot to TWRP and flash the downloaded ZIP from the latest release.
